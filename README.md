# Python script for summarizing financial record

Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records based on a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv].

The dataset is composed of two columns: 
- Date
- Profit/Losses

The Python script analyze the records to calculate the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average "Profit/Losses" changes over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
